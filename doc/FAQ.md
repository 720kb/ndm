## FAQ

**1) I use the CLI, why use an app?**

Of course, we all love the npm CLI, no jokes.

It is obviously very powerful.

*ndm* is an alternative experience to the `npmCLI` and here are all the pros:

- Less struggling with long terminal logs, scrolling to find eventual warnings and/or errors.
- All your projects are on the same view, no more multiple `cd` to move from a project to another, just drag them all into the app.
- Notifications (specially when your long long npm install finishes)
- List all your global and local npm installed packages with all the informations you need in one maybe two clicks.
- Cleaner point of view of all your npm projects and dependencies.
- Run npm commands and scripts in one maybe two clicks.
- More features to be finished and to come ...

Some of the greatest and widely used package managers got their own GUI... brew, apt ... just for example.
npm got none. That's bad, that doesn't help npm itself and the npm community.

Here is ndm, give it a try before to say "_no, mmmmm, no, meh, maybe_" :ok_hand:

**Obviously:** using **ndm** doesn't mean you can no longer use the CLI.

**2) Is ndm stable?**

The first releases are not guaranteed to be very stable, some problem/bug may happen.

Just give it some time, have some patience and if you like ndm project then come contribute! 
Your help is always appreciated and you are welcome anytime!


**3) Do i have to worry about anything when using ndm?**

Actually not, not really.
**ndm** does not run any malicious or env/system breaking commands in background, and it doesn't run anything outside of the npm native commands.

If you want to be 100% sure about it, just look at the source code, which is clear and very readable.

Then (if you have 5 minutes to spend) what we suggest is to read this tiny mini guide of sane [recommendations](https://github.com/720kb/ndm/blob/master/doc/RECOMMENDATIONS.md).

**4) Why is ndm so slow on my pc?**

**ndm** speed depends exclusively on your pc/device specs and [npm-cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) speed.
We can't do much to speed up your machine or the npm native commands.

**5) Yarn?**

_Premise: **ndm** was born several months before Yarn was out._

Yarn is a great tool, we are looking forward to seeing what happens: both on the Yarn and the npm side.

Many things could change in the meantime. 

That said: if you have any idea or suggestion you are welcome to share and discuss!

6) **Support?**

Just open an issue, we'll be in touch :ok_hand:
