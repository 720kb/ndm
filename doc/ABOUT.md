## About ndm

**ndm** stands for _"npm desktop manager"_ , a cross-platform GUI for [npm](https://npmjs.com/) built with web technologies.

With **ndm** you can manage npm, npm projects and packages straight from the couch.

**ndm** is packed up thanks to [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) and developed in HTML/CSS/JS powered by AngularJS, Sass and Pug.
